                        <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best – and most grueling – time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>
